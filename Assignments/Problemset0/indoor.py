#Problem statment

#In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. 
#Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, 
#as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

#intution -> take input and make all in lower case 

name = input("What's your name ?: ").lower()

print(name)
